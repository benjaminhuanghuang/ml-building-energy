## Reference
- A Complete Machine Learning Project Walk-Through in Python

## Objective
    The objective is to use the energy data to build a model that can predict the Energy Star Score of a building and interpret the results to find the factors which influence the score.

## Steps
1. Data cleaning and formatting
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature engineering and selection
4. Compare several machine learning models on a performance metric
5. Perform hyperparameter tuning on the best model
6. Evaluate the best model on the testing set
7. Interpret the model results
8. Draw conclusions and document work


## Setup python env
```
virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 venv3

. venv3/bin/activate

(venv3)$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

...
(venv3)$ deactivate

```
